### Layout

- Links visually indicate that they can be clicked, typically by being displayed using the visited or unvisited link system colors. Traditionally, links are underlined as well, but that approach is often unnecessary and falling out of favor to reduce visual clutter.

### Content

- People should be able to accurately predict the result of selecting a link based on its link text and optional tooltip.
- Use descriptive, actionable link text when possible. Avoid using URLs as link text.
- Don't use if the action is destructive or irreversible. Links aren't appropriate for commands with significant consequences.
- Keep discrete links far enough apart that people can differentiate between them and easily select each one.
- Don't use all-uppercase text. It's harder to read for everyone, but especially people with reading disabilities.
