### Layout

- Alternatively, use a check box when people need to perform extra steps for changes to take effect. For example, if they must click a "Submit", "Next", or "OK" button to apply changes, use a check box.

### Content

- Only replace the On/Off labels if there are more specific labels for the setting. For example, you might use Show/Hide if the setting is "Show images".
- Keep descriptive text short and conciseâ€”two to four words; preferably nouns. For example, "Focused inbox" or "WiFi".
